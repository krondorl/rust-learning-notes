## How to Learn Rust

On 3rd February 2023, I got a big inspiration to learn Rust thanks for this [Syntax.fm interview with Tim McNamara](https://syntax.fm/show/571/supper-club-rust-in-action-with-tim-mcnamara).

## About Me

I started programming in 1996 as a kid, learning Pascal, Assembly and C. I created the website of my elementary school in 1998.

I have been working professionally since 2007 as a front-end developer. My usual stack at the moment (2023) is TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular and React with some HTML5, CSS3 and SCSS coding. Sometimes I code backend in Node.js.

## Setting Up Development Environment

## Rust by Example

A very practical learning resource is [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/), which features runnables, examples and ideas.

## Topics

Watch Tim's short introductory video: [Rust Linz, June 2021 - Tim McNamara - How to learn Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDtQaO5_SOw).

> When starting to learn Rust, focus on structs, vectors, iteration, Result and Option.

Recommended subjects:

* [Structures (structs)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/structs.html)
* [Vectors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/vec.html)
* [Iteration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/for.html)
* [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/result.html)
* [Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html)

## Recommended Books

## Macros

I have never used macros before with a programming language, so this was very new for me.
